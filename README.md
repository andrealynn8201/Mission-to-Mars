# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview
The purpose of this repository is to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. I used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images, stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application (Flask) to display the data, and altered the design of the web app to accommodate these images (bootstrap).

The web page generated can be seen below
